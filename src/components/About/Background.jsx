                    Hailing from the foothills of Himalayas, while being raised in the Middle East, I am an
                    inquisitive person who loves to learn new concepts and theories in the field of
                    computer sciences, mathematics and machine learning. Starting this journey to learn something
                    new about computer sciences, I learnt about object-oriented programming, algorithms,
                    operating systems, software scalability, mobile development, digital systems and web
                    development and applied these ideas by building programs through programming languages
                    such as C, C++, Java, Verilog, JavaScript and Python.

                <p>
                    While learning these computer science concepts, I started to learn more about artificial intelligence
                    and machine learning as more businesses and research are applying its theories to
                    increase their productivity. Subsequently, I studied regression modelling,
                    probabilistic modelling, artificial neural networks and AI-algorithms. Using these notions,
                    I created machine learning models using Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow and PyTorch.

                    With such acquired knowledge and experience, I am open to collaborate with new and unique ideas.
